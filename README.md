# List of my AW statistics analyzes
****
All statistic was retrieved using my hand-made API that can be found [here](https://github.com/lookandhate/ArmoredWarfareAPI).

After completing analyzing the data using jupyter notebook, I usually write article in [PanzerSofa](vk.com/panzer_sofa) - game fan-public.
